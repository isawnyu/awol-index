            accordance with a structured data model. In continuous operation since 2009, <span
                class="title">AWOL</span> is a blog authored by <a
                href="http://viaf.org/viaf/66782017/">Charles E. Jones</a>, Tombros Librarian for
            Classics and Humanities at the <a href="https://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/home.html"
                >Pattee Library, Penn State University</a>. </p>
        <p> This publication, <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span>, is an experimental project,
            developed jointly by Jones and <a href="http://www.paregorios.org">Tom Elliott</a>, the
            Associate Director for Digital Programs at New York University's <a
                href="http://isaw.nyu.edu">Institute for the Study of the Ancient World</a> (ISAW),

        <p>Creation of <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> was made possible by a grant from
            the <a href="http://delmas.org/">Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation</a>.</p>
        <p>We extract information from <span class="title">AWOL</span> about both top-level and
            subordinate resources. Subordinate resources are those we deduce to be "part of" another
            resource (e.g., a single issue of a journal or a sub-section of a website). Top-level
            resources are the opposite: those resources described by <span class="title">AWOL</span>
            for which we have detected no containing/superior resource. </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The latest data extraction was performed on 9 July 2015.</strong> At that time,
            our software successfully extracted 1,301 top-level and 50,704 subordinate resources. For
            94% percent of the top-level resources it was able to extract a textual description
            substantively different from the resource title. Dates of individual source posts in
                <span class="title">AWOL</span> vary between 2009 and 2015; therefore, content in
                <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> will only be as current as the original
            blog post was on the day of extraction. </p>

                <dt>Deduplication</dt>
                <dd>Many resources are cited more than once in <span class="title">AWOL</span>, but
                        <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> should only have one record for
                    each resource. Cases of such repetition occur both within a single blog post
                    (e.g., when the title of a single thesis appears multiple times in a list, once
                    under each of several categories) and accross blog posts (e.g., in a descriptive
                    post about a single journal and in another post that lists a large number of
                    journals on a particular topic). It is necessary, therefore, for <span
                        class="title">isaw.awol</span> to detect each repetition of a resource and
                    judiciously to merge the data extracted in association with each. <br />
                    Repetition is detected during a parse session by keeping a list of resource keys
                    parsed previously during that session (see <a href="#naming">Record Naming</a>
                    for more information on resource keys). If a newly created resource key matches a
                    key already stored in the list, <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> reads the
                    previous resource record in from the corresponding JSON file and then attempts to
                    merge the newly parsed information into that record before saving it again.
                    <br /> Merge logic is conservative: best efforts are made to prevent discard of
                    data from either record. Identical values, of course, are always retained in the
                    result. When a particular field in one record is empty but in the other holds a
                    value, the value is propagated. When the field is a complex data type (like a
                    list of keywords), and the two records have differing values, the union set is
                    propagated. Only when both records have empty fields, or conflicting simple
                    values (e.g., if one contained "1923" in the <span class="code">year</span> field
                    and the other contained "1924"), is the merged output field left empty. In the
                    latter case, an warning message is generated and noted by the operator subsequent
                    investigation on the assumption that the parse logic in <span class="title"
                        >isaw.awol</span> is not coping well with content or structure in a
                    particular blog post. </dd>

                <dt>Language Identification</dt>
                <dd><span class="title">AWOL</span> blog posts do not generally contain a clear
                    indication of the language of the resources being described; however, they do
                    frequently contain descriptive text copied from the home page of the resource,
                    and this often is in the language of the resource itself. The <span class="title"
                        >isaw.awol</span> package feeds the contents of the resource title and
                    description to <a href="https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py">Marco Lui's <span
                            class="title">langid</span> package</a> in an attempt to classify the
                    language in question. If <span class="code">langid.classify()</span> returns a
                    language identification with a confidence value greater than or equal to 0.98,
                    the language code and confidence value are stored in the JSON record.</dd>

                <dt>Provenance</dt>
                <dd>In order to acknowledge the dependency of a given record on external resources,
                    to attribute derived information to its original source(s), and to facilitate
                    downstream attribution and assessment of validity, completeness, and timeliness,
                        <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> embeds provenance information in each
                        <span class="title">AWOL Index</span> record. We employ terms from two open
                    vocabularies to express relationships between each <span class="title">AWOL
                        Index</span> record and one or more other sources. When we extract
                    information from an <span class="title">AWOL</span> blog post, two provenance
                    entries are created. The first uses the "citesAsDataSource" term from the <a
                        href="http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/http://purl.org/spar/cito">Citation
                        Typing Ontology (CITO)</a> to link the <span class="title">AWOL Index</span>
                    record to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom XML</a> version
                    of the blog post from which it was created using the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_URI">Tag URI</a> assigned to that
                    Atom XML entry by the <span class="title">Blogger</span> system. We also use the
                    CITO term "citesAsMetadataDocument" to point at the original blog post itself by
                    way of its URL. When <span class="title">awol.index</span> merges two records,
                    all provenance entries in the source records are copied into the output. In
                    addition, a new provenance entry is made to document the fact of the merge using
                    the "Combine" term from <a href="http://purl.org/net/wf-motifs">The Workflow
                        Motif Ontology</a>.</dd>

                <dt id="naming">Record Naming</dt>
                <dd>Each record in the <span class="title">AWOL Index</span> needs a unique
                    identifier for retrieval, filenaming, and other tasks. We use a two-part "context
                    and key" approach. Records are grouped by the hostname portion of the URL
                    associated with the resource it describes (e.g. www.perseus.tufts.edu or
                    trismegistos.org). Within each group, each record gets a unique "resource key"
                    that identifies it in the context of that host domain. Ideally, we would use the
                    "slug" portion of the resource URL (i.e., everything after the hostname portion),
                    but this is impractical for several reasons, including the massive length of some
                    URLs, the inclusion in many of application-related elements that confer little
                    value as titles or filenames (e.g., "php"), and the appearance of characters
                    inimical to or annoying to deal with in filenames. Therefore, isaw.awol uses the
                    following heuristics to construct the resource key for each record: <ul class="tight bullet">
                        <li>seperate the slug from the host and protocol portions of the URL</li>
                        <li>if the URL has no slug (i.e., the resource being described is located at
                            the top level of the specified host name), then re-use the domain name in
                            the following steps as if it were the URL slug</li>
                        <li>in the slug, replace all slashes, spaces, periods (full stops), commas,
                            and the like with hyphens</li>
                        <li>normalize repetitive characters</li>
                        <li>if the result is longer than 80 characters or contains ampersands,
                            question marks or whitespace, calculate a hash value from the modified
                            slug using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1</a>
                            algorithm.</li>
                        <li>The result, or the hexadecimal digest of the SHA1 hash (if necessary), is
                            used as the value of the resource key.</li>
                    </ul> Resource keys are not only used for filenaming, they are embedded in the
                    records themsleves. They are also used to detect duplication (q.v.) during
                    parsing. </dd>

                    records. Original HTML structure and formatting is used extensively to facilitate
                    parsing of the original blog posts, but these elements — which necessarily vary
                    widely in the original content — are superseded by the uniform structure of the
