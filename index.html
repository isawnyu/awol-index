        This publication systematically describes ancient-world information resources on the world-wide web. The bibliographic data presented herein has been programmatically extracted from the content of

        (<abbr title="International Standard Serial Number">ISSN</abbr> 2156-2253) and formatted in accordance with a structured data model.
        In continuous operation since 2009,
        <span class="title">AWOL</span>
        is a blog authored by
        <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/66782017/">Charles E. Jones</a>,

            </p>
    <p>
        This publication, <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span>,
        is an experimental project, developed jointly by Jones and
        <a href="http://www.paregorios.org">Tom Elliott</a>,
        the Associate Director for Digital Programs at New York University's
        <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu">Institute for the Study of the Ancient World</a> (ISAW),
        with the assistance of

        <p>Creation of <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> was made possible by a grant from the <a href="http://delmas.org/">Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation</a>.</p>
            <p>We extract information from
                <span class="title">AWOL</span>
                about both top-level and subordinate resources. Subordinate resources are those we deduce to be "part of" another resource (e.g., a single issue of a journal or a sub-section of a website). Top-level resources are the opposite: those resources described by
                <span class="title">AWOL</span>
                for which we have detected no containing/superior resource. </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The latest data extraction was performed on 9 July 2015.</strong> At that time, our software successfully extracted 1,301 top-level and 50,704 subordinate resources. For 94% percent of the top-level resources it was able to extract a textual description substantively different from the resource title. Dates of individual source posts in <span class="title">AWOL</span> vary between 2009 and 2015; therefore, content in <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> will only be as current as the original blog post was on the day of extraction.

It is the only journal in Central and Eastern Europe focused on all fields of palaeobotanical and palynological investigations and publishes original palaeobotanical, palaeoecological, palaeophytogeographical, palynological, and archaeobotanical papers in addition to monographs, comprehensive review and discussion articles and book reviews. The journal is open to contributors from all over the world. It is published regularly with one volume per year each comprising two numbered parts, printed in June (No. 1) and in December (No. 2). The language of the journal is English. All manuscripts to be published in the journal are peer reviewed by at least two referees, and after acceptance of corrected manuscripts printing time is only approximately 6 months. Acta Palaeobotanicais now an open access journal and currently abstracts and full text of the articles in the PDF format beginning from volume 1 (1960) are freely accessible onwards here. The internet service also provides catalogues for volumes and supplements published since 1960 and includes information on ordering forms of printed copies."</div>

            <dd><span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to store the structured bibliographic records dervied from <span class="title">AWOL</span> blog posts. The HTML pages and indexes are derived from these JSON files. See <a href="#data-model">data model</a> for information about the fields used in the JSON files.</dd>
            
            <dt id="data-model">Data Model</dt>
            <dd>The records that <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> produces conform to a flat, idiosyncratic data model informed by the <a class="title" href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms</a> and the <a class="title" href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)</a> (among others). We chose to create our own data model in JSON rather than an established, standard format for several reasons:
            <ul class="tight bullet">
                <li>the varied and idiosyncratic nature of the material being catalogued necessitates a format and schema that can be modified on the fly as new attributes of interest are identified</li>
                <li>JSON is quick and easy to read and write from Python</li>
                <li>JSON is terse, unambiguous, and easily read with any text editor</li>
                <li>JSON is is well understood as a format by developers outside humanities and library software communities and readily used in web applications</li>
            </ul>
            We anticipate no difficulty in converting JSON to other formats for use in other systems.
            <br />
            See our <a href="#dictionary">Data Dictionary</a> for definitions of all data fields.</dd>
            
            <dt>Deduplication</dt>
            <dd>Many resources are cited more than once in <span class="title">AWOL</span>, but <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> should only have one record for each resource. Cases of such repetition occur both within a single blog post (e.g., when the title of a single thesis appears multiple times in a list, once under each of several categories) and accross blog posts (e.g., in a descriptive post about a single journal and in another post that lists a large number of journals on a particular topic). It is necessary, therefore, for <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> to detect each repetition of a resource and judiciously to merge the data extracted in association with each. 
            <br />
            Repetition is detected during a parse session by keeping a list of resource keys parsed previously during that session (see <a href="#naming">Record Naming</a> for more information on resource keys). If a newly created resource key matches a key already stored in the list, <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> reads the previous resource record in from the corresponding JSON file and then attempts to merge the newly parsed information into that record before saving it again.
            <br />
            Merge logic is conservative: best efforts are made to prevent discard of data from either record. Identical values, of course, are always retained in the result. When a particular field in one record is empty but in the other holds a value, the value is propagated. When the field is a complex data type (like a list of keywords), and the two records have differing values, the union set is propagated. Only when both records have empty fields, or conflicting simple values (e.g., if one contained "1923" in the <span class="code">year</span> field and the other contained "1924"), is the merged output field left empty. In the latter case, an warning message is generated and noted by the operator subsequent investigation on the assumption that the parse logic in <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> is not coping well with content or structure in a particular blog post. 
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Language Identification</dt>
            <dd><span class="title">AWOL</span> blog posts do not generally contain a clear indication of the language of the resources being described; however, they do frequently contain descriptive text copied from the home page of the resource, and this often is in the language of the resource itself. The <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> package feeds the contents of the resource title and description to <a href="https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py">Marco Lui's <span class="title">langid</span> package</a> in an attempt to classify the language in question. If <span class="code">langid.classify()</span> returns a language identification with a confidence value greater than or equal to 0.98, the language code and confidence value are stored in the JSON record.</dd>
            
            <dt>Provenance</dt>
            <dd>isaw.awol embeds provenance information in each <span class="title">AWOL Index</span> record. We employ terms from two open vocabularies to express relationships between each <span class="title">AWOL Index</span> record and one or more other sources.

            <dt>Structured Data</dt>
            <dd><span class="title">AWOL</span> blog posts are descriptive documents. In contrast, the individual entries in <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> are structured data records in which the discrete elements of description (metadata) have been separated into standard fields. None of the HTML tags in the original blog posts are carried over into <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> records. Original HTML structure and formatting is used extensively to facilitate parsing of the original blog posts, but these elements — which necessarily vary widely in the original content — are superseded by the uniform structure of the data model imposed by <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span>.</dd>
            <dt>Text Encoding and Normalization</dt>
            <dd>All text in HTML files is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> encoded. All text in JSON files is also UTF-8 encoded; however, all characters therein whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> code points fall outside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Latin_(Unicode_block)">Basic Latin block</a> (i.e., non-<a title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> characters) have been escaped using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html#unicode-literals-in-python-source-code">the standard Python notation for "Unicode literals"</a>.
            <br />
            Content from <span class="title">AWOL</span> is, in part, collected from a vast variety of web pages around the world. Consequently, the original text formatting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>, and associated factors (e.g., <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode Normalization Form</a>) also vary. Jones is at pains when collecting and updating information to ensure that all text incorporated into the blog, regardless of original language, writing system, and encoding, displays in a readably consistent manner in modern web browsers. This effort helps ensure that the <span class="title">AWOL</span> export file (in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom format</a>) that is parsed to produce <span class="title">The AWOL Index</span> conveys all textual content using the UTF-8 encoding. The <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> package takes further steps to detect and repair text whose character encoding or HTML structure is broken, deploying <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Leonard Richardson's <span class="title">Beautiful Soup</span></a> Python library for the purpose.
            <br />
            Text is further normalized to facilitate consistent display, sorting, searching, and comparison in downstream and third-party processing. All character text is converted to <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Norm_Forms">Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC)</a>. The Python standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/unicodedata.html">unicodedata</a> library is used for this purpose. A number of character replacements are performed as well, including the conversion of:
            <ul class="tight bullet">
                <li>all hyphen and dash variants (including non-breaking and "soft" hyphens) into simple hyphens,</li>
                <li>left- and right-double quotation marks (and "Microsoft Smart Quotes") into simple double quotation marks,</li>
                <li>the Unicode ellipsis character (\u2026) into a string of three simple periods (full stops), and</li>
                <li>all continuous strings of one or more whitespace characters (including tabs, new lines, and non-breaking spaces) into a single simple space character.</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="title">isaw.awol</span> sometimes adds periods (full stops) to text in place of HTML &lt;br&gt; tags when the text will be used as part of a longer description.</dd>
