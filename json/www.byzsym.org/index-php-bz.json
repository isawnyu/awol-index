    "description": "[First posted on AWOL 29 March 2009. Updated 7 July 2013]. ΒΥΖΑΝΤΙΝΑ ΣΥΜΜΕΙΚΤΑ - BYZANTINA SYMMEIKTA. ΒΥΖΑΝΤΙΝΑ SΥΜΜΕΙΚΤΑ is an international peer-reviewed open-access electronic journal published by the Institute for Byzantine Research (IBR) of the National Hellenic Research Foundation (NHRF). It provides a forum for the publication of original research in the field of Byzantine studies. We invite articles from a broad range of fields within Byzantine studies, and are especially interested in promoting interdisciplinary approaches. ΒΥΖΑΝΤΙΝΑ SΥΜΜΕΙΚΤΑ also publishes book reviews in Byzantine Studies. The Ιnternational Editorial Advisory Board appointed every four years as well as the rigorous publication procedures ensure the journal maintains a high standard of scholarship. Taking advantage of the capabilities of open-,source publishing software ΒΥΖΑΝΤΙΝΑ SΥΜΜΕΙΚΤΑ provides free access to high-quality scholarly research to everyone, and helps maximize the impact of research. A fully electronic publication management system ensures a speedy process, and offers authors the ability to follow the progress of their manuscripts through the publication process. Revised manuscripts of accepted articles are published immediately upon submission of the final version. Each volume comprises the total of the articles published during the year. A print edition appears at the end of every year. The Greek Documentation Center (EKT), also part of the NHRF, provides publication management and technical support for the electronic publication of BYZANTINA SΥΜΜΕΙΚΤΑ.",
