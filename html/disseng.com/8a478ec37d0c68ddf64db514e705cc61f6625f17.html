      <dd>&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href=&quot;http://disseng. com/&quot;&gt;catalogue of Russian dissertations&lt;/a&gt; is now available online. There is a substantial selection of &lt;a href=&quot;http://disseng. com/page/cat/pko/281/s/2/st/0. html&quot;&gt;archaeology titles&lt;/a&gt;, many, perhaps most of them otherwise unavailable. The titles listed appear to be machine translated into English. Twenty-five page samples of each title are offered, but were not available for any that I tried. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The service promises, for a reasonable fee, to be able to supply a pdf of the each dissertation in one day, or for slightly more a pdf + machine translation in two days. Prices for pdf + professional translation depend on the size of the work and requires 5-10 days. &lt;br/&gt;. I have not yet tried to order a copy. If anyone has, I would appreciate comment below. &lt;/p&gt; catalogue of Russian dissertations &lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href=&quot;http://disseng. com/&quot;&gt;catalogue of Russian dissertations&lt;/a&gt; is now available online.
