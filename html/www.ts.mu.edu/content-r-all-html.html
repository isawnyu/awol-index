      <dd>Theological Studies is a quarterly journal of theology, published under the auspices of the Jesuits in the USA. Located at Marquette University, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it is under the general editorship of David G. Schultenover, SJ, in concert with its editorial consultants. Its book review editor is R. Daniel Kendall, S. J. , of the University of San Francisco. Founded and sponsored by the Society of Jesus in the United States of America, Theological Studies is a Catholic scholarly journal that serves the Church and its mission by promoting a deeper understanding of the Christian faith through the publication of research in theological disciples. Through refereed articles and reviews of noteworthy books, the journal aims to recover and to help make accessible the riches of the theological tradition, and to present significant developments in current theology. It is published quarterly in English for an international readership. Theological Studies is now making past articles as well as book reviews available for individual download, after the item has been in print publication for five full years (e. g. , those published in 2006 are available for download beginning in the year 2012).
