      <dd>Latin Teaching Materials at Saint Louis University. The ultimate outcomes of Latin studies relate to your quality of consciousness, and to the breadth and depth of your vision. You do not even know who you are if you have no memory. If you develop your memory of and appreciation of significant realities, if you learn how to judge what is helpful and admirable and what is not, then you are being helped to becoming a greater person yourself, that unique &quot;greater person&quot; that you are called to be. (&quot;Become who you are!&quot; says Pindar. ) Latinity is a significant part of the past for us. We have to know it to more fully know who we are culturally, but it also gives us a wealth of material that can help us to fashion ourselves individually. Latest Developments.</dd>
