      <dd>Announced today: OIMP 35. Between Heaven and Earth: Birds in Ancient Egypt Purchase Book Download PDF Terms of Use Issued in conjunction with an exhibit at the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of Chicago, this is the first comprehensive study of birds in ancient Egyptian society, economy, art, and religion. Essays address the role of birds in the religious landscape, their use in hieroglyphic and Coptic scripts, birds as protective symbols, as decorative motifs, and as food. A group of essays on “Egyptian Birds and Modern Science” presents the newest forensic research on bird mummies. Other articles address bird behavior as shown in Egyptian art and the present state of avifauna in the Nile Valley. The catalog describes forty artifacts, many of which are previously unpublished. An index of bird species makes this volume useful for naturalists as well as for Egyptologists and art historians. Table of Contents Foreword. Gil J. Stein Preface. Jack Green Introduction.
