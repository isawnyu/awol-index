      <dd>Grace White dissertation now available online. August 28, 2014 The dissertation of Grace White entitled The Religious Iconography of Cappadocian Glyptic in the Assyrian Colony Period and its Significance in the Hittite New Kingdom is now available online through the Dissertations page of the Research Archives. The study was completed in December 1993 for the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago. The purpose of White's study &quot;is to analyze the themes and motifs on native Anatolian seal impressions representative of the Cappadocian glyptic of the Assyrian Colony period. The analysis is made from many points of view and on many levels. The local glyptic is studied in the context of other glyptic styles, such as Old Babylonian, Old Assyrian, Middle Assyrian, and Mitannian. A precise identification of objects utilized on the local Anatolian glyptic is attempted, using textual evidence and giving archaeological parallels for pottery types, etc. &quot;.</dd>
