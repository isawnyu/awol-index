The pioneering work of Marquart on the historical geography of the Sasanian Empire in the book of Ps. - Moses of Chorene is one of the earliest studies of its kind.

During the last decades R. Gyselen and Ph. Gignoux have significantly contributed to the field of Sasanian historical and administrative geography through their publications and scrutiny of the sigillographic, numismatic and written sources. &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;http://www. sasanika. org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika6-Miri. pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Historical Geography of Fars during the Sasanian Period Author: Negin Miri, University of Sydney There are few studies in existence which explore the Sasanian historical geography.
