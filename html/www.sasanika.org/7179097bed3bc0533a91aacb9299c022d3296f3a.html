Unfortunately the location of this coin today is unknown to us. At first sight, the coin looks like the usual issues of Shapur I (particularly the iconography in obverse), but exploration of some details in reverse give us cause to suppose that it was minted for a certain occasion. Shapur I continued the regional policy of his predecessor, Artashir I, from the beginning of his reign. A series of victories against the Roman Empire opened the way to conquer Armenia, which was the main success of Sasanian Iran in the West. Shapur I represented his glorious victories against Roman Empire in rock sculpture and took a new title, king of kings Iran and non‐Iran, as a result of his successful policy. &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;http://www. sasanika. org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika4-Zohrabyan. pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; An Exceptional Gold Coin of Shapur I Author: Armine Zohrabyan, History Museum of Armenia Recently we have had a chance to see a unique gold coin of Shapur I.
