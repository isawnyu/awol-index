      <dd>Dacia: Revue d'archéologie et d'histoire ancienne. In 1924 under the signature of Vasile Pârvan as director and fonder was issued the first number of the &quot;Dacia - Recherches et découvertes archéologiques en Roumanie&quot;, the first journal with articles about ancient history and archaeology, written in foreign languages. The Vasile Pârvan's dream was to make in this journal a forum for archaeological debates and for presentations of the newest archaeological discoveries all over Romania. From the beginning the use of the foreign languages and the quality standards imposed to the published materials have turned the name of DACIA in a brand well known everywhere in the archaeological circles. Unfortunately the evolution of the journal is under the sign of many interruptions. The old series founded by Vasile Pârvan in 1924 ends with the XI-XII issues published in 1948. The journal renewed his existence in 1957 at the celebration of 65 years from the birth of Vasile Pârvan with a new series. Since then till now were published 49 issues from this Dacia New Series. Every single number of the new series has in wide lines the same structure as the old series, containing studies, research reports, annual archaeological chronicles, abstracts, book reviews and book presentations. Through the year great personalities of the Romanian archaeology such as: Vasile Pârvan, Ioan Andrieşescu, Ion Nestor, Vladimir Dumitrescu, Martin Roska, Dorin Popescu, Gh. I. Brătianu, Vasile Christescu, Theophile Sauciuc-Săveanu, Gh. Ştefan, P. Nicorescu, C. S. Nicolăescu-Plopşor, Eugen Comşa, D. M. Pippidi, Radu Vulpe, Grigore Florescu, Dumitru Berciu, Constantin Daicoviciu, Ion Barnea, K. Horedt, I. I. Russu, Bucur Mitrea and much more then thishave signed the articles. About the project of bringing up-to-date the index of DACIA and also about the digitalisation of the first series of the journal (1924-1948) Starting from June 2006 began the improving process of the Dacia's index. The web page was created in 2001, when was put on-line the index made in a collaboration between the Institute of Archaeology from Bucharest and cIMeC - The Institute for Cultural Memory. The database contained all the titles belonging to the issues from 1924 to 1998. Now, after the improving process the database contains 1333 recordings from 1924 till 2005. The search can be made by author, year or by title. We intend to add in the near future the possibility of a more refined search by epoch, locality and key words. We began also scanning and image processing for the first series of Dacia containing twelve numbers which we published it entirely for free on our web site. In this way this rare numbers of the journal will be accessible, a useful tool for the students and specialists in the field of archaeology. We hope that our project will be successful and well received by the students, specialists and also other categories of public for us to keep going on making the largest archaeological library on-line from Romania.</dd>
