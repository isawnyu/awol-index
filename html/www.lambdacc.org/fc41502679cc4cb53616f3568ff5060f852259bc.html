      <dd>Iris:Â  The Newsletter of the Lambda Classical Caucus. &lt;blockquote&gt;The Lambda Classical Caucus is a coalition of queer Classicists-including, but not limited to, lesbians, bisexuals, gay men, and transgendered people-and their friends and supporters. It was founded in 1989 as the Lesbian and Gay Classical Caucus. Although Lambda is a group affiliated with the American Philological Association, LCC members need not belong to the APA. Anyone who wishes to participate, and who is sympathetic to our mission, is welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www. lambdacc. org/membership. html&quot;&gt;join the LCC&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of the Caucus is twofold: scholarly and political. Our scholarly purpose is to promote research that reflects the personal and intellectual interests of queer scholars, and provide a bridge between Classics and the interdisciplinary fields of LGBT/Queer Studies, the history of sexuality, cultural studies, and gender theory. Our main activities are hosting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www. lambdacc. org/panels/index. html&quot;&gt;academic panels&lt;/a&gt; and co-hosting the opening-night reception at the annual APA meeting. We also sponsor an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www. lambdacc. org/list. html&quot;&gt;email discussion list&lt;/a&gt; and the annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://www. lambdacc. org/awards/rehak. html&quot;&gt;Rehak Award&lt;/a&gt; and also a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www. lambdacc. org/awards/graduate. html&quot;&gt;Graduate Student Paper Award&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt; join the LCC &lt;blockquote&gt;The Lambda Classical Caucus is a coalition of queer Classicists-including, but not limited to, lesbians, bisexuals, gay men, and transgendered people-and their friends and supporters.
