      <dd>Wings Over Armenia. In 2002, ACE and the British Academy funded the launch of Wings over Armenia. The project aim is to support Armenian science and the introduction and development of aerial archaeology in Armenia. The first stage of the project took place in June 2002 when Rog Palmer and Hayk Hakobyan conducted ground reconnaissance of an area identified for study from the air. The aerial exploration itself was planned to take place in late-September and October 2002. At the time, Wings over Armenia had virtually no equipment to carry out its intended work. Fortunately the project was discovered by the British Council, an organization disseminating the United Kingdomâ€™s experience and creative vision in science, arts and education. The British Council Office in Yerevan responded generously to a plea for funding and enabled the scientists to acquire a two-person paramotor (powered parawing) for aerial exploration.</dd>
