      <dd>[First posted June 8, 2009; I slamic Heritage Project addedDecember 21, 2009]. Through its Open Collections Program, the Harvard University Library is presenting new, virtual collections of thematically linked material selected from numerous Harvard repositories. For the study of the ancient world, the Expeditions and Discoveries: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age provides access to field notes, letters, maps, photographs, and published materials relating to a range of worldwide expeditions from 1626 to 1953. Archaeological projects in Expeditions and Discoveries are. Carnegie Institution/Peabody Museum Expeditions to Kaminaljuyú, Guatemala, 1935–1953 Between 1935 and 1953, the Carnegie Institution of Washington excavated Kaminaljuyú and established it as one the most significant archaeological Pre-Columbian sites in Mesoamerica. Kaminaljuyú (meaning, in the Quiché language, &quot;Hills of the Dead&quot;) grew from an agricultural community (ca. 2500 BCE) in the central highlands of Guatemala to become a large ceremonial site and political Maya capital that flourished until about 800 CE. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ocp. hul. harvard. edu/expeditions/ciwpeabody. html&quot;&gt;Carnegie Institution/Peabody Museum Expeditions to Kaminaljuyú, Guatemala, 1935–1953&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Between 1935 and 1953, the Carnegie Institution of Washington excavated Kaminaljuyú and established it as one the most significant archaeological Pre-Columbian sites in Mesoamerica.
