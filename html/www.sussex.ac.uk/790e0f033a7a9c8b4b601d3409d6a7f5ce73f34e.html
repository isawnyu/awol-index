      <dd>The Composition of Byzantine Glass Mosaic Tesserae. &lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Welcome to the database of sites and sources of Byzantine mosaic glass tesserae. Follow the links on the left to enter one of three databases: &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;'Structures' records buildings (4C-15C) where we have archaeological evidence (finds) of glass wall mosaics. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'Texts' contains records of primary Byzantine sources which mention mosaics (in development). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'References' is a bibliographical database of modern scientific publications about glass mosaics. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The databases can be searched or browsed for information and the method should be straight forward. &lt;h4&gt;Notes:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have not included structures for which there is only evidence of glass mosaics on floors. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The database does not contain records of mosaic icons. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Names: we have used mostly Byzantine names of places so Nicaea, not Iznik; Constantinople, not Istanbul. Building names are given in English, unless mostly known in the wider world in their original language (hence Rome, not Roma; Hagia Sophia, not Holy Wisdom). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spelling: we have followed the spelling of the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium. Hence: Demetrios, not Dimitrius; Photios, not Photius. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have only included buildings that are no longer extant if the mosaics survive elsewhere (the only exception to this is the record for Odalar Camii). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'Unknown' can designate that it really is unknown or that research of published data has not produce an answer yet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The structure database allows you to search for structures and mosaics between dates. Chose the early century in &quot;Century of xxx 1' and the later or the same in 'Century of xxx 2'. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The databases have been designed and constructed by the University of Sussex Web Team in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www. sussex. ac. uk/profiles/28613&quot;&gt;Bente Bjornholt&lt;/a&gt;, the Leverhulme Network Facilitator.
