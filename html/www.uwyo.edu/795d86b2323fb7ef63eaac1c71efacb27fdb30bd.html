      <dd>Annoted Justinian Code. About Fred H. Blume and the Annoted Justinian Code From about 1920 to 1952, Fred H. Blume, attorney and Wyoming Supreme Court Justice, worked alone in his spare time to produce a massive, annotated English translation of Justinian’s Code. His hopes of seeing it published during his lifetime never came to fruition. Blume also translated Justinian’s Novels into English during the same period, but they, too, remained unpublished. This web site is dedicated primarily to housing an edited, electronic version of Justice Blume’s magnum opus--what he referred to as his ANNOTATED JUSTINIAN CODE. It also contains his translation of the Novels and other materials related to Justice Blume’s Roman law work, but it does not attempt to be a portal for research on the Code or Roman law in general.</dd>
