      <dd>[First posted in AWOL 2 March 2011. Updated 24 January 2012]. Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies Newsletter. The program, scheduled for the years 2009-2014, aims at facilitating cross-cultural academic dialogue and active exchange in the field of Oriental manuscript studies with the focus on the Mediterranean and North African cultural areas. So far no such exchange has been conducted systematically on a European level, having become an urgent desideratum. Standards in all subfields of manuscript studies differ from one study area to another and from one national scholarly tradition to another. Oriental studies are considerably behind Occidental manuscript studies, where, e. g. , Greek and Latin philology have reached a high standard. Since some regional and linguistic cultures have been studied more intensively than the others in different aspects, an exchange within the framework of Oriental philology will give possibility for Europe-wide development through network activities. The co-ordination will on the one hand enable a high degree of standardization between the cultural and language areas and on the other hand facilitate the explication of culture-specific methodologies. In some areas, already advanced in classical and medieval European philology, such as, e. g. , digital philology including digitisation of manuscripts and computer-supported text-editorial practices, Oriental studies are still at the very beginning. The joint European efforts will lead to a break-through in the field. Not only specialists working in different cultural fields but also those dealing with different subdisciplines of manuscript studies will combine their expertise working in five internationally composed research teams (1: codicology and palaeography, 2: philology/text criticism, 3: digital approach to manuscript studies, 4: cataloguing, 5: manuscript preservation). In a series of workshops, meetings and conferences, common approaches will be achieved that will serve as standard for contemporary and future Orientalists and manuscript scholars. Relevant by-products of the RNP will include a series of publications, digital databases and a textbook in Oriental manuscript studies. The aims set can only be achieved through a Europe-wide co-operation. Newsletter 1, 2011. Newsletter 2, 2011. Newsletter 3, 2012. Newsletter 4, 2012.
