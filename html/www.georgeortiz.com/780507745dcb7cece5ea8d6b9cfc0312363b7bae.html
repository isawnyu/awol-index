      <dd>The George Ortiz Collection. Welcome to The George Ortiz Collection web site. For some 42 years I passionately and assiduously pursued works of art from Greece, as well as from some of its forerunners, Mesopotamia and Egypt, and its peripheral cultures spanning a period of time from the Neolithic to the Byzantine Empire; also sculptures from Africa, Pre-Columbian America and the Pacific. One day, as though I'd spent my life painting a huge fresco, it all came together, and I decided to share with the world. Visitors to the exhibitions of the Collection, whether young or old, and from all walks of life, seemed to perceive the essence of the different cultures represented and their interaction. For those who have seen one of the exhibitions, and especially for those who have not had the opportunity, this web site offers the full corpus of the Collection, with 20 key works presented in a 3-D format for your understanding and enjoyment. Fully-searchable catalogue entries are available for each object, as well as glossaries. Additionally, there are news about exhibitions and information about the printed versions of The George Ortiz Collection catalogue, the standard reference on the Collection. Unfortunately we cannot respond to all inquiries; but any comments you may have are deeply appreciated. May I express the hope that you will enjoy this site. George Ortiz.
