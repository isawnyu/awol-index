Subscriptions are free. Copyrights are retained by authors. By submitting a paper to Structure and Dynamics authors grant a license to publish the paper in electronic form, and at our option in printed or other forms. Once accepted and published, authors also grant a license to any user of this journal to download and print the paper, and to cite from it subject to normal standards for reasonable scientific use. Publications are not subject to correction except through errata. Proofreading and copy editing are the responsibilities of the authors. Papers submitted to Structure and Dynamics are published soon after their acceptance and final preparation. All papers are peer reviewed. Our contacts with reviewers operate by a speedy and automated process, and we encourage reviewers to return their reviews within one month. Reviewers have an option for anonymous email exchanges with authors. They are also permitted to reveal their identities if they wish. Publication in refereed electronic journals should count equally to paper media in academic review for merits and promotions. Once an article is published, authors receive counts of downloads that are important evidence of the impact and readership of the article.
