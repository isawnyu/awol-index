      <dd>Unscrambling the 'Uplands': Satellite Imagery and the Homs Basalts (Oct. 2007). This presentation forms part of a a collaborative British-Syrian project called Settlement and Landscape Development in the Homs Region, Syria, that seeks to compare human activity in adjacent but contrasting landscapes in a typical part of western Syria. In this case we focus on an upland landscape, where stone architecture is the expectation. In the traditional literature, most discussion of such areas has concentrated upon the evidence for activity of Graeco-Roman date - the Dead Cities of the Limestone Massif on north-western Syria are an excellent example. However, we have very little knowledge of the evidence for earlier periods. This is, we suspect, because we have little idea of what we should be looking for. &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Petrie07. php&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;small&quot;&gt; Cameron Petrie, Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Petrie07. php&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Remote Sensing in Inaccessible Lands: Plains and preservation along old routes between Pakistan and Afghanistan&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Sept. 2007). The current political situation in many areas of Western and Central Asia makes effective ground based archaeological research virtually impossible. Whilst people are generally cognisant of the situation in Iraq, this is also true for Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan. Furthermore, since the mid-19th century, the mountainous regions that comprise the eastern borderlands of modern Afghanistan, along with the western parts of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and the Tribal Areas of modern Pakistan have been difficult to access for extended periods. However, with the widespread availability of free or inexpensive satellite imagery, it is now possible to 'visit' these regions by looking at them from space. The use of satellite imagery in this way has a number of specific archaeological applications, including the reconstruction of ancient routes, the remote detection of archaeological sites and the assessment of site destruction and looting. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Petrie07. php&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;small&quot;&gt; Cameron Petrie, Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Petrie07. php&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Remote Sensing in Inaccessible Lands: Plains and preservation along old routes between Pakistan and Afghanistan&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Sept. 2007).
