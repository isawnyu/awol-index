      <dd>Why an electronic atlas of archaeology? (2004). When astronauts first took photographs of Earth from space, it transformed traditional images of the planet. Here, for the first time, were photographs of the world as it actually is. Systematic use of this information was at first confined to military objectives, but nowadays these images are familiar, as the backdrop to news items and weather forecasts. Moreover, they are now available as continuous cover, and can themselves be used as maps. ArchAtlas began in Oxford in 2000, as a means of making available the kinds of images and interpretations which are more easily disseminated through a website than by conventional paper publication. &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/Trade/Trade. php&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;small&quot;&gt; Andrew Sherratt &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/Trade/Trade. php&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Trade Routes: the Growth of Global Trade&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2004). One of the most evident features of the human past is the growing scale of connections between areas, shown for instance by the movement of materials (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/ObsidianRoutes/ObsidianRoutes. php&quot;&gt;Obsidian Trade&lt;/a&gt;). Although the current phase of &quot;globalisation&quot; is unique in its range and impact, it was preceded by many earlier episodes of expansion and collapse. These maps reconstruct how such networks develop, and show how they follow a logic reflecting both their own geometry and that of the Earth's surface, and how they sometimes come to a catastrophic stop. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/Trade/Trade. php&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;small&quot;&gt; Andrew Sherratt &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/Trade/Trade. php&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Trade Routes: the Growth of Global Trade&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2004).
