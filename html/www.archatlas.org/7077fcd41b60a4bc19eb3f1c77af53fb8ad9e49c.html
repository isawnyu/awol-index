      <dd>Obsidian Trade ). Although the current phase of &quot;globalisation&quot; is unique in its range and impact, it was preceded by many earlier episodes of expansion and collapse. These maps reconstruct how such networks develop, and show how they follow a logic reflecting both their own geometry and that of the Earth's surface, and how they sometimes come to a catastrophic stop. &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/SitesFromSatellites/SatSitesList. php&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;small&quot;&gt; Andrew Sherratt &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/SitesFromSatellites/SatSitesList. php&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Sites from Satellites&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2004). The resolution of satellite-imagery in the public domain is constantly improving. Although images with the resolution hitherto obtainable by aerial photographs are still expensive, imagery with a resolution of 15m or better is routinely available for most parts of the world, thanks principally to NASA. For some areas, this is already better than most maps. It is especially useful in areas with strong vegetational contrasts depending on water-sources. Selected key sites are presented here, as they can be seen from space. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/SitesFromSatellites/SatSitesList. php&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;small&quot;&gt; Andrew Sherratt &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www. archatlas. org/SitesFromSatellites/SatSitesList. php&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Sites from Satellites&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2004).
