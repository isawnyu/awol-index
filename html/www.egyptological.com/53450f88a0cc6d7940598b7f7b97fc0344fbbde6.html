      <dd>Egyptological. &lt;blockquote&gt;Egyptological is a new concept in archaeological publishing, which is available free of charge to all readers. Part of the Egyptological Online (E. O. ) group of websites Egyptological was founded by Andrea Byrnes and Kate Phizackerley in 2011. Our idea was to provide the first free online-only Egyptology magazine which would provide our readers with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A free-of-charge resource&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A diverse selection of high quality material to reflect varied levels of academic and popular interest, all subject to editorial review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research papers and popular articles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhibition, book, DVD and website reviews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conference reports&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Events and course calendars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A regularly updated photograph gallery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A platform for both new and existing writers to publish their material in a friendly and helpful environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assistance for new writers if required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to join a community of like-minded people to advance the spread of good quality information about ancient Egypt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Egyptological covers all areas and periods of ancient Egyptian prehistory up to and including the Coptic period. If you have an interest in Ancient Egypt we hope that you will find articles, exhibition, book and DVD reviews, and much more value-added content to keep you entertained and informed. &lt;br/&gt;Egyptological provides an environment for writers and researchers of all levels of experience.
