      <dd>STAPLE: Group for the Study of Ancient wild Plant Economy. Most of the researchers donÂ´t know what other investigators are doing, in which sites are they working, with which aims or perspectives. Many people are maybe working in the same or similar directions without knowing it. Groupsites are a new class of websites that empower people to come together and make things happen. The sharing of information makes research more dinamyc and the groupsite allows conversations and discussions my means of the shared blog or via forum. This site is a public meeting place that provides members of Group for the Study of Ancient Wild Plant Economy with a shared calendar, discussion forums, member profiles, blog, file storage and more. So we invite all archaeologists, archaeobotanists or researchers interested in how past wild plant management took place to join us and participate!!! The blog, as well as all the site possibilities, are open for all group members. Home Profil Members Blogs Forums Images Events Files.</dd>
