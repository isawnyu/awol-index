      <dd>CAA: Computer Applications &amp; Quantitative Methods in Archaeology: Proceedings. &lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;CAA is an international organisation bringing together archaeologists, mathematicians and computer scientists. Its aims are to encourage communication between these disciplines, to provide a survey of present work in the field and to stimulate discussion and future progress. &lt;a href=&quot;http://caaconference. org/membership/&quot; title=&quot;Membership&quot;&gt;Membership&lt;/a&gt; is open to anyone on payment of a nominal fee. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;Annual_Conference&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Annual Conference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/span&gt;CAA organises an annual international scientific conference, where practitioners can present their work in paper sessions, and discuss developments with colleagues from all over the world in round tables and workshops. The conference sessions cover a wide range of topics, including data acquisition and recording, conceptual modelling, semantic technologies, data analysis, data management, digital 3D object reconstruction, image visualisation in archaeology, geophysics and GIS. &lt;br/&gt;. Papers presented at CAA conferences are published in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://caaconference. org/proceedings/&quot; title=&quot;Proceedings&quot;&gt;CAA Proceedings &lt;/a&gt;, that are peer-reviewed and published within one year of the conference.
